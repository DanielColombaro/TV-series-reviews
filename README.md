# TV-series-reviews
The project displays how to perform data retrieval through:
* REST API calls from IMDb website using 'requests' library
* Web Scraping using 'BeautifulSoup' library

The datasets were subsequently cleaned from inconsistencies, duplicates and missing values. Afterwards, they were merged into a single integrated dataset to perform comparative statistical analysis on the ratings of TV series across different review digital platforms.

The research questions of the statistical analysis were:
* How do TV series ratings from different data sources compare? Is there a source associated with a higher rating than the other?
* Does the genre play a role in the rating? Are there genres with higher ratings than others?
